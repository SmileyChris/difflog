# Future Roadmap

This section outlines potential features, long-term goals, and experimental ideas for the evolution of diff·log.

## Vision

diff·log aims to become the definitive "intelligence layer" for developers, bridging the gap between passive news consumption and active workflow integration.

## Planned Features

- **CLI Interface**: A native terminal client for generating and reading diffs (see [CLI Interface](cli.md)).
- **Team Profiles**: Shared configuration for engineering teams to stay aligned on their specific stack.
- **IDE Integration**: Extensions for VS Code and Neovim to bring diffs directly into the editor.
